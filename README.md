# rla_lookbook_flip
interactive flipbook for refinela's runway lookbook by editorial 

## things i learned
## to style elements: title {} the element tag is different from .title{} the class name
## z-indices organize how elements are arranged (larger = more on top)
## checkbox labels control transformations, trigger next page to show 
## event listeners in javascript monitor for certain actions (click, toggle), triggers an action (get, activate, check)
## adjust inner pages to be slightly smaller so no overlap, remove margins so pages don't stuck out
